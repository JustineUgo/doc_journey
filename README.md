# doc_journey
A personal project to structure out how I spend my days on my computer. The main aim, is to figure out how long i spending coding and doing programming related stuffs. In the long run, It will serve as a documentation of my journey, as I build up my career.

## Future
Would love to make the script run automatically, when the computer is put on. Also, the information will later be put on my porfolio website, for personal use. And, so the service will continue be routed with some sort of api.
